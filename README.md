# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview
### Purpose
The goal is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. I have used a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website to retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. I have taken this information and visualized it onto a world map.

Approach:
- use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. 
- use the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
